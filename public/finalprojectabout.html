                <h3>Project Background</h3>
                <p>This website has been developed as a final project for INST377, a Dynamic Web Applications course.</p>
                <p>
                    The object of this assignment was to focus on an issue and utilize a public API to resolve it. 
                    In our case, we have decided to focus on the ongoing issue of health decline within the citizens of the United States.
                    To address this issue, we used a health API called Nutritionix to provide feedback on a user's food consumption.
                </p>
            </div>
    
            <!--Call to Action-->
            <div>
                <h3>Call to Action</h3>
                <p>
                    Start improving your daily diet right now with a simple form.
                    Gathering only non-invasive information, the intake form can let you know how close you are to reaching your nutrition intake goals made to your convenience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your well-being is our concern, and we hope to aid you in your journey of leading a healthy lifestyle.
                </p>
            </div>
    
            <!--Future Plans-->
            <div>
                <h3>Future Plans</h3>
                <p>
                    If this project were to be further developed, we would like to add further details in the Home and About page as well as add additional features to our Functionality page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We could go past the nutrion intake calculation and develop a system that recommends ingredients to you based on your current nutrition intake.
                    The more information a user could receive, the more they could take initiative to maintain a balanced diet with confidence.
